# 1. Java - Whatâ€™s OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm centred around the concept of objects, which **encapsulate** both data and methods to operate on that data. 
Contrary to procedural programming, where procedures or functions manipulate data, 
**OOP** emphasises the organisation of code into discrete (separate, distinct, or individually identifiable), reusable units called objects. \
**OOP** offers several advantages over procedural programming:\
**Efficiency**: **OOP** can often be faster and easier to execute due to its modular nature, allowing for more efficient reuse of code.\
**Structure**: **OOP** provides a clear structure for the programs, making it easier to understand and maintain.\
**DRY Principle**: **OOP** supports the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle by enabling the extraction of common code into reusable components, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.\
**Reusability**: **OOP** facilitates the creation of reusable components, leading to shorter development times and less code duplication.

# 2. Java - What are Classes and Objects?
A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. \
**Example**:\
class: Fruit \
objects: Banana, Apple, Mango

# 3. Java Classes and Objects
In Java, everything is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For instance, in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.\
A Class is an object **constructor**, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
